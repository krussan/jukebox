# jukebox
Yes. It's another movie jukebox identifier.

Still an early alpha version release.

It identifies your videos, lookup information on them and tries to 
download subtitles (currently just english) for your specific video.

It has it's own android app (not available yet through Play Store but 
can be installed manually) from which you can browse the repository and 
start your videos.
Frontends for the video playback include Google Chromecast, VLC (RC or 
web) and the bundled JukeboxFront (very much wip on this one)

## Installation
- unpack the zip file
- modify the settings.
- start up
- watch the logs

## Android app
### Installation
### Startup
Be sure to click on the three dots on the main screen to set the ip and 
port number of your server. After that you are good to go. Push the 
refresh button and your repository will hopefully appear.

## Work to do
Ther is still a lot of work to do to get this up and running.
Browse the github repository for all issues currently under consideration or review.
