## TazMo: Privacy policy

Welcome to the TazMo Android app and server implementation!

This is an open source Android app and server available on GitHub under
the MIT license. The app is also available on Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously, and I know how irritating it is when apps collect 
your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences and cached settings) created by the you is stored on your device only, 
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, 
or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, 
please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Christian Thunstr√∂m
