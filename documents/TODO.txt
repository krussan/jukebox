Jukebox issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix communication. Something rotten
- Fix subtitles for TV episodes
- Refactor TV episodes. Today the identification process is all over the place. Move this identification to the respective builders.
- Update Android App to ProtoDB protocol.
- Update communication system to ProtoDB protocol.
- Make the TV Series appear on another screen in android app.
- Fix non-iso characters in save / html scraping - is this a ProtoDB issue??
- black-listing doesn't work (no connection / no comm log)
- IMDB identifier and Watcher runs on the same thread.. why is that?
- Parser builder does not work well on 24.S09E04.HDTV.x264-LOL
- Make a better subtitle downloader. 400 subtitles for each episode of The Following is not reasonable.
x - Blacklist does not work because IMDB_ID is null for every movie
- Does blacklisting re-enqueues the file on the identifier? It did before but can't find the logic now.

- 2014-07-08 - Started to implement an instance of a movie layout for series (breaking the build.. but not checked in)
- 2014-09-01 - Far down the lane towards complete fuck-up. Tried to add a JukeboxFragment that involves switching between
     two views in the main Activity. One for movie, one for series.
     A new concept of Slice that is either a Movie or a Series.
     All builders should really be returning a pre-populated Slice. Assignement of Media could still be in MovieBuilder, but the rest
     with Series/Episodes should be done in each builder.
     New objects Series/Season/Episode
- 2014-09-02 - Ok. Fixed the layout in android app somewhat. Need to write scripts to update DB to new schema version.
- 2014-09-02 - Serious breakdown. Is this really a good design. Slices has been abandoned. We do a Series/Season/Episode hierarchy.
     We get some dependency issues when trying to match the identified file with existing structure. 
     The function matchMovieWithDatabase need to be updated with matching code for Series/Season/Episode as well.
     I have done a single identification that does the whole hierarchy, but that is not enough. We need to separate them and insert
     the real object into the result
- 2015-01-30 - ERROR - Fixed most of the structural layout of the domain objects. Decided on a Series/Season/Episode version where a media file
     can be part of either a Movie object or an Episode object. These two have almost the same properties.
     Some issue where the series are filled every time from IMDB. This should not be the case. If the series exist - continue to the 
     season/episode
- 2015-02-08 - FIXED - nullpointer exception in IMDBRecord. -> Missing enumeration member in imdb.xsd
- 2015-02-08 - FIXED - regex on FirstAirDate does not work. Takes too long to execute.. Handled now by rewriting the regex to only parse the date. 
			Does this really work as expected??
- 2015-02-09 - FIXED - regex on FirstAirDate somehow picks up the wrong date. American Horror Story goes from 5 Oct. 2011 -> 1 Apr. 2012 ??
			COMMENT: IMDB returns different values based on regional settings. Our HttpUrlConnection uses swedish air date where as my firefox
				 uses the american release date. Fixed by setting default language on HttpConnection to en-US!
- 2015-02-10 - FIXED - DB search does not identify already registered series.
- 2015-02-23         - Error seems to stem from db.find(<Series>)
- 2015-02-24 - FIXED - DB search seems fixed but an error when getting next episode. 
			Could this be because we have no URLS on series stored?
- 2015-02-24 - FIXED - Delete does not work either. Error in ProtoDB? *sigh*
- 2015-02-24 - FIXED - We still have som orphaned records in DB relating to series. Could this be an effect of the previous error?
- 2015-02-27		Yep. thats it. Records were orphaned due to previous error
- 2015-02-27 - FIXED - Almost working now. The old episode links in the season object are erased. Could this be related to that season object is created anew?
			The code should not take that path.
- 2015-03-08         - The episodes are not read back when reading the series! Should be a protoDB issue?
			- yep. when doing a DB.get only the last episode exist in the resulting object!
			- eeh. no. the episodes to series table is not populated.
			- Either protoDB does not save both entries, or the links are erased when populating the new object.

			- Rewrote the logic somewhat. IMDB should not check if the series hierarchy exists. Actually it will now fail if it doesn't
			- Still error that simpy one link record is stored in DB. Or just one record re-read upon select?
			- Must be a protoDB error. Before saving we have 2 episodes, but only one gets stored to DB!?
- 2015-03-08		- FIXED - yep. Error in protoDB that removed all links from the source object. Correct would be to remove objects with the target ID.
			- 	- Also a bit of confusion with new objects after imdbIdentifier has run and after mediaIndentifier. We need to get the new objects
				- after these have been created before each new step.
- 2015-03-09 - FIXED - We appear to get duplicates in the episodes. This results in flooding of the database.
- 2015-03-11		- Looks ok in database? Error on retreive?
			- No. Media gets duplicated. Not episode/season/series hierarchy!
			- Media is ALSO correct in DB. must be a serious protoDB issue?
			- No. Link table EpsiodeMedia_Media is incorrect! Was this due to the change that we erased the "otherID"? (as of 2015-03-08)
- 2015-03-11		- Yeah. It was the deleteLinkObject in protoDB. Modified to only remove one (!) row.
- 2015-03-11 - ISSUE - story on series (season/episode as well?) does not get the "full summary" but gets the hyperlink. Haven't we fixed
			this for movies?
- 2015-03-11 - FIXED - we have some problems with episodes that have the episode title in them. These are identified as a new series:
			- example: Homeland Drone Queen WEB DL
			- example: Sons of Anarchy The Mad King
			- we should be able to fix this (somewhat) by identifying the series by the name preceeding the s01e01 tag.
			- will not work for all, but this seems to be the most used pattern.
			- Fixed by ParserBuilder!
- 2015-03-09 - WORK IN PROGRESS - Android app have now been fitted with series response object. Need to create the GUI accordingly.
- 2015-03-11 - ISSUE - What if we have the same episodes but with two different filenames/paths??
- 2015-03-11 - FIXED - Example "House of Cards" gets new series every time! why is that?
			- Probably because the title is changed after IMDB call. Before it searches for "House of Cards Chapter"(!)
			  as this is part of the "non-numeric" fields after season and episode have been parsed away.
			- Added a new field "identifiedTitle" to use for this purpose.
- 2015-03-14 		- Made the move towards removing the PartPattern and letting ParserBuilder handle all identification. 
			- Moved a lot of code around to the builder instead and removed settings from the main xml file.
			- Started implementing JUnit tests for the parser builder... too little too late.. but anyways.
			- REALLY GOOD WORK TODAY!
	

- 2015-03-14 - ERROR - Subtitle downloader need to be fixed after the above changes.. .but what else is new.
- 2015-03-17 - HOLD - NFOBuilder does not correctly identify series. Series are ignored if pattern found for now.
- 2015-03-17 - FIXED - NFOBuilder does not include media
- 2015-03-17 - WISH	- If we look at the files it seems to update the date parameter when it was last modified.
			- If we can set some values on "how long" is acceptable before we assume the file is complete, then
			- we can detect when the download is complete
- 2015-03-20 - WISH     - Thumbnail of poster will be sent down to android device
- 2015-03-20 - BUG	- href links remains in story field. Parse them away and fix "Plot summary" issues
- 2015-04-05 - BUG	- Front does not set fullscreen. Apparently this is a "feature" in Ubuntu. Switching to other desktop
			- managers is recommended. Otherwise installing this and setting "legacy fullscreen support" works.
				sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
				under utility/workarounds enable "legacy fullscreen support"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
x - ProtoDB. ORM-mapping tool. One tool to rule them all?
x - Correctly identify TV episodes
x - Fix upgrading and backup/restore of database during upgrade
x - BUG: when purging database the version info is removed. This needs to be preserved somehow
x - RPC server is shutting down immediately. Why is that? - Gaah. Yes it will shutdown immediately if there is another process running which is occupying the port. With no error actually. Grr.
x - Switch to token builder?
x - Fix token builder for TV episodes
