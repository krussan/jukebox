Jukebox issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix communication. Something rotten
- Fix subtitles for TV episodes
- Refactor TV episodes. Today the identification process is all over the place. Move this identification to the respective builders.
- Update Android App to ProtoDB protocol.
- Update communication system to ProtoDB protocol.
- Make the TV Series appear on another screen in android app.
- Fix non-iso characters in save / html scraping - is this a ProtoDB issue??
- black-listing doesn't work (no connection / no comm log)
- IMDB identifier and Watcher runs on the same thread.. why is that?
- Parser builder does not work well on 24.S09E04.HDTV.x264-LOL
- Make a better subtitle downloader. 400 subtitles for each episode of The Following is not reasonable.
x - Blacklist does not work because IMDB_ID is null for every movie
- Does blacklisting re-enqueues the file on the identifier? It did before but can't find the logic now.

- 2014-07-08 - Started to implement an instance of a movie layout for series (breaking the build.. but not checked in)
- 2014-09-01 - Far down the lane towards complete fuck-up. Tried to add a JukeboxFragment that involves switching between
     two views in the main Activity. One for movie, one for series.
     A new concept of Slice that is either a Movie or a Series.
     All builders should really be returning a pre-populated Slice. Assignement of Media could still be in MovieBuilder, but the rest
     with Series/Episodes should be done in each builder.
     New objects Series/Season/Episode
- 2014-09-02 - Ok. Fixed the layout in android app somewhat. Need to write scripts to update DB to new schema version.

Environent Issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------
x - Fix a way to debug Android App
- Fix "Install new software bug in Eclipse"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Done
---------------------------------------------------------------------
x - ProtoDB. ORM-mapping tool. One tool to rule them all?
x - Correctly identify TV episodes
x - Fix upgrading and backup/restore of database during upgrade
x - BUG: when purging database the version info is removed. This needs to be preserved somehow
x - RPC server is shutting down immediately. Why is that? - Gaah. Yes it will shutdown immediately if there is another process running which is occupying the port. With no error actually. Grr.
x - Switch to token builder?
x - Fix token builder for TV episodes
x - Fix <span> tags in IMDB finder for genre

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Probably fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Check and maybe fix imdb finder. 0 records retreived?
